# Tailtrail
Cozy life-sim game with social and farming mechanics.

### Made with Unity, target platform is Desktop (Windows, Linux, Mac)

I am not planning to release for WebGL, Android and other platforms for now.

## **Under development/prototype**

Game is proof of concept. Not all mechanics are implemented. Simple and most important things were done except intro and NPC mechanics. In future I will try to finish this project and implement all features.
